# CS229: Machine Learning (Stanford - Summer 2020)

This repository serves as a comprehensive technical portfolio for the **Stanford CS229: Machine Learning (Summer Edition)**. It integrates theoretical derivations, numerical implementations, and a formal research project.

## Why Summer 2020 Edition?

As an Electrical and Electronics Engineer specializing in AI/ML, I have specifically chosen the **Summer 2020 Edition** (instructed by Anand Avati) for its unique focus:

* **Mathematical Rigor:** Unlike standard sessions, this version emphasizes the analytical derivations of algorithms.
* **First Principles:** Focuses on foundational Matrix Calculus, Probability, and Optimization.
* **Advanced Topics:** Includes in-depth coverage of Gaussian Processes, EM variants, and Variational Autoencoders (VAE).

## Repository Structure

* **`/Notes`**: Detailed Obsidian notes (Markdown + $\LaTeX$) focusing on mathematical proofs and interdisciplinary intuitions.
* **`/Notebooks`**: Hands-on Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating concepts using **Python & NumPy** (e.g., Vectorized operations, manual Gradient Descent).
* **`/Assignments`**: Problem sets and algorithmic implementations from the course syllabus.
* **`/Final-Project`**: 
    * `Code/`: Reproducible implementation of the final research project.
    * `Paper/`: A formal academic paper (NIPS/ICML style) detailing methodology and results.
    * `Poster/`: A high-level technical poster for visual synthesis of the findings.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Environment
